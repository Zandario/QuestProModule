A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod that brings the Quest Pro's [eye tracking](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/move-eye-tracking/) and [natural expressions](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/move-face-tracking/) to [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) avatars.

2. [a relative link](/releases/latest)
3. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/dfgHiatus/QuestPro4Neos/releases/latest) of this mod and place it in your mods folder.

A big thanks to [Geenz](https://github.com/Geenz) for their contributions and testing this mod, not owning the headset myself this would not be possible without them. Check out their fork [here](https://github.com/Geenz/QuestPro4Neos)
